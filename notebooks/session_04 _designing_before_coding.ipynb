    "# Session 04 – Designing Before Coding: The Map of Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Why We Don’t Start Coding Immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "When learning to program, it’s tempting to jump straight into writing code. But good programmers think first, then code. Just like engineers don't build a machine without a blueprint, programmers shouldn't write code without a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a *map* — a visual and logical plan of how information flows and how the system should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 The Thinking Tools So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s review what we’ve learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm**: Step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.\n",
    "- **Flowchart**: A diagram that shows the flow of decisions and processes.\n",
    "- **Pseudocode**: A structured way to describe logic using plain English, not real code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are tools for **thinking and planning** before coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗺️ Designing a Map of the Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool gives us a different view of the same logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tool        | Purpose                               |\n",
    "|-------------|----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Algorithm   | Defines the steps                     |\n",
    "| Flowchart   | Visualizes the flow and decisions     |\n",
    "| Pseudocode  | Bridges natural language and code     |\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose one, two, or all three — the important part is to **create a logic map** before coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Example – Quality Control System\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine a quality control system. A part will be inspected in three ways:\n",
    "- Is its **weight** within the allowed range?\n",
    "- Is the **temperature** acceptable?\n",
    "- Is there any **visual damage**?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here’s one way to map this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "1. Get weight, temperature, and visual status.\n",
    "2. If weight is not OK → mark as defective.\n",
    "3. If temperature is not OK → mark as defective.\n",
    "4. If visual damage is present → mark as defective.\n",
    "5. If all checks are OK → mark as good.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudocode**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "START\n",
    "    GET part weight\n",
    "    GET part temperature\n",
    "    ASK user: \"Is the part visually damaged? (yes/no)\"\n",
    "    IF weight is not OK THEN\n",
    "        OUTPUT \"Defective part – weight out of range\"\n",
    "    ELSE IF temperature is not OK THEN\n",
    "        OUTPUT \"Defective part – temperature issue\"\n",
    "    ELSE IF visual damage is \"yes\" THEN\n",
    "        OUTPUT \"Defective part – visual damage\"\n",
    "    ELSE\n",
    "        OUTPUT \"Part is good\"\n",
    "    ENDIF\n",
    "END\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✏️ Mini Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a logic map for this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The user enters a number. If it’s even, the program says “Even number.” If it’s odd, the program says “Odd number.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to create:\n",
    "- A **short algorithm**\n",
    "- A **simple flowchart** (on paper or with diagrams.net)\n",
    "- Some **pseudocode**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement it in Python in the next session. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code:\n",
    "- Understand the problem.\n",
    "- Design the logic.\n",
    "- Map out the steps and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way, coding becomes easy — because you’ve already solved the problem logically!\n"
