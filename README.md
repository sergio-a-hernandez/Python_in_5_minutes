# Python_in_5_minutes

Welcome to **Python in 5 Minutes**, a growing collection of micro-lessons designed to help busy learners master Python through short, focused sessions. Whether you're a professional, student, or simply curious, this repository will guide you step by step using hands-on examples and visual explanations.

Each session is designed to be completed in about 5 minutes, making it easy to build momentum and confidence without overwhelming your schedule.


## 💡 Why This Project?

Most people think learning to program takes hours of reading and coding. But consistent, bite-sized learning is often more effective and sustainable — especially for professionals who need just enough Python to automate, analyze, or improve their work.

**No prior coding experience is required.** We’ll start from the basics — even before writing your first line of Python.


## 🚀 How It Works

- Each lesson is delivered as a **Jupyter Notebook**.
- Lessons include **explanations**, **examples**, and **mini-exercises**.
- Notebooks are stored in the `notebooks/` folder and labeled by session.

You can run them:
- Locally using [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- Online using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)


## 📘 Sessions Overview

| 02      | [Flowcharts and Logical Thinking](notebooks/session_02_flowcharts.ipynb) | Coming soon |
| 03      | Your First Python Program            | Coming soon |
| 04      | Variables and Data Types             | Coming soon |
| 05      | Input and Output                     | Coming soon |

*More sessions will be added regularly.*


## 🧰 Requirements

To run the notebooks locally:

```bash
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
````

Or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) — no setup needed!
